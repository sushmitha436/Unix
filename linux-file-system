                                  LINUX-FILE-SYSTEM



    Unix uses a hierarchical file system structure, much like an upside-down tree, with root (/) at the base of the 
file system and all other directories spreading from there.

      A Unix filesystem is a collection of files and directories. It has a root directory (/) that contains other files 
and directories.

The directories have specific purposes and generally hold the same types of information for easily locating files. 
Following are the directories that exist on the major versions of Unix âˆ’

1.  /
    This is the root directory which should contain only the directories needed at
 the top level of the file structure.

2.  /bin
      This is where the executable files are located. These files are available to all users.

3.  /dev
   These are device drivers.

4.   /lib
     Contains shared library files and sometimes other kernel-related files.

5.   /boot
   Contains files for booting the system.
